# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is controller?

It's the interface between user and MOD, composed by: knobs, displays, footswitches and LEDs. The controller has its own processor (actually a microcontroller) regardless of main mod processor. As many others MOD's components, the software running inside of controller is also updatable, an usual term for this is "firmware upgrade".
Sometimes you might see mentions of controller as HMI, which technically stands for Human Machine Interface, but we prefer to say that is Human MOD Interface.
